### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel and I'm currently based in Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. </br>
I've been working within the hotel industry but since the start of the pandemic in 2020, I have been focusing on changing career paths. </br> 
I have always been very interested in technology and decided to dive deeper into web-development with the goal of becoming a front-end developer
